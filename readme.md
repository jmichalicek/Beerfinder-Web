# What is this?

This is a project for experimenting with a variety of things while also running a site that I
would find useful if it gets to a point where others would use it.  It is a social web app and
api for potential native apps for logging and locating beers, primarily with seasonal or limited
release brews in mind.

## What tech is it using?
* Django 1.7
* GeoDjango
* PostgreSQL with PostGIS
* Django REST Framework
* requirejs and r.js
* knockoutjs (may experiment with angular and full on single page web app style)
* sass and compass
* Bootstrap 3 with the intent to also experiment with Foundation 5

## Other stuff

* Why are you comitting scss and compiled css?
    * Because that's the easiest way to use compass with Django and it is the recommended method of the compass developers - http://compass-style.org/blog/2011/05/09/compass-django/.
